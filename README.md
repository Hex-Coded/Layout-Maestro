Simple but powerful tool to control your window layout how you see fit.
Its default state is to sit in the background and listen for processes to open.
When it detects a process has opened, it will position and scale the window once at app start.
(This simply puts windows in the same size and place each time they are launched)

There are utilities to launch all missing windows for a given profile, close, hide, focus all, and more.
Options to automatically relaunch a process if it is shutdown.
I use this for coding, hacking, and trading. Quite useful imo!
